1. [Python and CNN basics](/01_Python101/README.md)
   This first session quickly recaps python, numpy basics and moves on to the basics of Neural Networks and their architecture, channel formation, kernels / feature extractors etc.

   Curiosity breadcrumbs:
   
   a. why 3x3 kernels?
   
   b. why odd numbers in kernel dimensions (e.g. 3x3, 5x5 etc) and why not even?
   
   c. why kernel size matters?
